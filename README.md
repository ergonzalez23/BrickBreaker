# BrickBreaker
 
First 2.5D game created after hours of research and youtube videos, contains a basic menu UI, simple settings to control game volume and to change game resolution. I have only added one level of the classic brick breaker game which has a chance to spawn two temporary power ups.

Controls for this game are to move the paddle use keyboard buttons A (left) or D (right). Using Number 1 on the keyboard at any point to pause the game.

Still need to add a 2nd level with the option of adding permanent powerups and/or an option to increase you life count. At the moment I have not added a winning scenario for beating the first level but will add it in due time.

This was my first attempt at making my own game after watching many tuturial vidoes on YouTube. There is no specific guide I followed for game play mechanics but there is a guide I followed to help create the setting UI.

Update.
